  Fitness will change your life!<br>

Not just because you look better‚Ä¶That's just icing on top of all the value fitness can add to your life.<br>

You'll be more confident, disciplined, determined, focused, just to name a few qualities.<br>

You'll look, feel and function better.<br>

Fitness changed my life completely. As a teenager, I got out of shape, I lacked confidence and direction in life. Starting to work out was, is and always will be the best decision of my life!

<br>In this journey, I've had a lot of ups and downs, injuries, self doubt, social pressure and I had to make many tough choices and sacrifices.

<br>But would I go through all of it again?

<br>In a heartbeat!<br>

May 30 2016 - The day is I started working out. This is how I looked before‚Ä¶



<br>From the moment I stepped foot in the gym and started eating healthy, my desire to improve and my dedication to be my best motivated me.

<br>This is how I transformed over the years‚Ä¶</p>



<p align="right"><br>29 March 2017 (Went from 85kg to 68kg)


<br>By this time I was hooked with the results I was seeing, I couldn't believe what I saw in the mirror!</p>

<p align="left">13 Nov 2017 (Went up to 72 kg)


<br>7 Mar 2018 (Bulked up to my biggest at 85kg)


<br>13 Aug 2018 (Lost muscle due to injury - 72 kg)

<br>Lost a total of 6 months due to Injury.

<br>Went from doctor to doctor, clueless as to why I couldn't recover. Physiotherapy didn't work, X-rays didn't show anything. The MRI later showed that I had bulging disc in my L3 region of the spine.

<br>During this time, I realised I had hypothyroidism all these years. That's why I got fat and that's what's slowing down my recovery. This was a hard pill to swallow.

<br>This was the lowest phase of my life.

<br>But this is the time that transformed me the most as a person. It's like they say ‚Äú Diamond is made under immense pressure‚Äù.

<br>I took this time to expand my knowledge, read books, do onine fitness certifications, rehab.

<br>22 Mar 2019 - The doctor cleared me to start training again.


<br>I put all my knowledge to use and this time around I appreciated the opportunity I had to train again. I was grateful. I was determined more than ever!


<br>Finally I recovered to be better than ever before! Infact, the injury was instrumental in my transformation as I mended my ways, started training better and respecting my body more!

<br>8 July 2019 - Started Athlean AX1 training program

<br>These pics are from 10 Aug 2019


<br>22 Aug 2019 - Don't skip leg day ü¶µüèª


<br>22 Nov 2019 - Lost a little bit muscle but my abs are here üòù


<br>16 Apr 2020 - This is me today, 1.5 months into Athlean inferno max shred.



<br>Still a looooong way to go. Many decades of training, a lifetime of fitness, health and happiness üôåüèª

<br>You don't need to be a fitness freak like me but this goes to show, if you put in the time and effort, you can make wonders happen.

<br>If that fat, naive 16 year old kid could do this, anything is possible!

<br>Hope this helps üòÑ
